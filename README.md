# A Multimodal fMRI Approach to Spatial Memory Processing: Task Activation and Network Connectivity in ADHD vs. Controls

## Project Overview

This study investigates neural network alterations associated with spatial working memory processing in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using a comprehensive fMRI analysis approach. The project examines how brain activation patterns and functional connectivity differ between neurotypical controls and individuals with ADHD during rest and spatial memory capacity tasks.

## Research Questions

1. How do spatial working memory networks differ between ADHD and control populations during task performance?

2. What connectivity patterns emerge during rest versus active spatial memory processing?

3. Can machine learning approaches identify reliable neural signatures that distinguish ADHD from neurotypical brain function?



# Analysis Pipeline:

First-level analyses characterize individual subject activation patterns contrasting task versus rest conditions. 

Second-level group analyses examine main effects and interactions between diagnostic group and task condition. 

Advanced connectivity analyses using machine learning techniques identify network-level differences and potential biomarkers of ADHD-related spatial memory dysfunction.
